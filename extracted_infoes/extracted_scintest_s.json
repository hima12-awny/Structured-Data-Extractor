Failed entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school (later ETH) in Zurich at sixteen, but excelled in physics and mathematics. Completed secondary education at Argovian cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896. Enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school in Zurich. Graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900. Secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern in 1908. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zurich's luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship. Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich, to take up a chair in theoretical physics. Membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin",

      "academic_background": "Planck came from a traditional, intellectual family. He enrolled at the University of Munich in 1874, studying under professor Philipp von Jolly. He then went to the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin for a year of study with physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Kirchhoff and mathematician Karl Weierstrass. In October 1878, Planck passed his qualifying exams and in February 1879 defended his dissertation \u00dcber den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (On the Second Law of Mechanical Heat Theory). By the year 1880, Planck had obtained a doctorate degree and a habilitation. In April 1885, the University of Kiel appointed Planck as associate professor of theoretical physics. In 1889, he was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Berlin and by 1892 became a full professor. He retired from Berlin on 10 January 1926.",
